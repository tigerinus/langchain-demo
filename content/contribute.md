# How can I get involved? üßê

CasaOS is a community-driven open source project and the people involved are CasaOS users. That means CasaOS will always need contributions from community members just like you!

## Coding üíª (WIP)

We are refining [documentation](/en/contribute/development) that can be used for effective community collaboration. Feel free to start a discussion if you have a good idea.

## Helping Users üí¨

If you have extensive knowledge of CasaOS and related areas. We highly encourage you to help others as much as you can in Discord and Discussions.

Discord: [https://discord.gg/knqAbbBbeX](https://discord.gg/knqAbbBbeX)

GitHub Discussions: [https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/discussions](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS/discussions)

## Helping with Translations üåç (WIP)

CasaOS officially supports English and Chinese. You are welcome to help make CasaOS available in more languages.

## Performing Alpha Testing ‚ö†Ô∏è

Alpha testing is quality assurance testing that is engaged and driven by the community. It's a great way to get involved in contributing and experiencing the latest features before a new release.

The documentation is being refined and you can contact @JohnGuan via [Discord](https://discord.gg/knqAbbBbeX). Ask to join the #casaos-alpha channel.

## Writing Documentation üìñ (WIP)

Help make our documentation better by writing new content for the CasaOS Wiki, correcting existing material, or translating content into new languages. For general usage of Wiki editing, checkout [this Markdown editing guide](https://docs.requarks.io/editors/markdown). To ensure a consistent format in which Wiki content is presented, here are [some guidelines for Wiki editing](/en/contribute/wiki-editing-guidelines).
