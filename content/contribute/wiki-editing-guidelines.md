> To ensure a consistent format of all contents in this Wiki, the community has came up following guidelines for editors to follow.
{.is-info}

## General

- DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

  > Hint: Link to the referenced information instead of duplication

- Well maintained readability

  - Typo-free is a MUST
  - Reasonable structure

- Try not to maintain rapid changing information

  - reference to how to obtain such information instead of providing the information directly.

- NEVER share any credential information for production environment in documentation

  - e.g., passwords, access tokens, secret keys

- Copy and format the text content of commandline output, instead of pasting a screenshot.

- If possible, should use a Markdown linter and fix all errors and warnings.

  - e.g. https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint
  - e.g. https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint

## Wiki specific

- Every page must have a title

- Every page should have the title of its parent page as its *Short Description*

  - e.g. This page's short description is *Contribute*.
  
## Behavioral

- Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, assume that people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it.

- Do not use this Wiki to promote yourself, your website, your mixtape, or your organization.

- Do not spam.

- You can use a user page to add a little information about yourself, instead of revealing yourself in other pages.
